Annealing for Mixture Models
============================

Implementation of the Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, an algorithm based on simulated annealing. Also includes code for comparing SEM to traditional Expectation-Maximization and Deterministic Annealing Expectation-Maximization, two of the most commons methods for estimating mixture models.

This was a final project for Stats 608A, Fall 2015 at the University of Michigan, taught by Professor Ambuj Tewari.
